## ‚öΩ Dataset Content

This project uses two cleaned datasets:

- `epl_cleaned.csv`: Contains structured data covering player attributes, match performance, and team-specific metrics.
- `epl_final.csv`: Aggregated and transformed version optimized for dashboard presentation and advanced visualizations.

---

## üìä Business Requirements

- Enable strategic insights into player and team performance.
- Build interactive visualizations for scouting, fan engagement, or fantasy football strategy.
- Provide accessible analytics for both technical and non-technical users via an intuitive dashboard.

## üß™ Hypotheses and Validation

## **Hypotheses and Validation**

- **Hypothesis 1: Home teams have a scoring and winning advantage.**  
- *Validation:* The bar chart comparing total home vs away goals shows that home teams score significantly more goals. The match result distribution pie chart confirms a higher proportion of home wins, supporting the home advantage theory.

- **Hypothesis 2: Most matches have a moderate number of goals (2-3 goals).**  
*Validation:* The histogram of total goals per match reveals a peak around 2 to 3 goals per game, consistent with typical football scoring patterns.

- **Hypothesis 3: Goal-scoring rates vary across the season.**  
*Validation:* The monthly average goals line plot shows fluctuations, including a dip in winter months, confirming seasonal effects on scoring.

- **Hypothesis 4: Top scoring teams dominate both home and away matches.**  
*Validation:* The top 10 scoring teams bar chart aggregates goals from both home and away fixtures, identifying consistent high scorers.

- **Hypothesis 5: Teams have distinct tactical profiles based on scoring patterns.**  
*Validation:* The clustering analysis groups teams into high-scoring, defensive, and balanced clusters, confirming varied playing styles.

- **Hypothesis 6: Expected goals (xG) correlate closely with actual goals scored.**  
*Validation:* The scatter plot comparing synthetic xG and actual goals demonstrates a positive correlation, though some teams deviate, indicating over- or under-performance.

- **Hypothesis 7: Teams accumulate points steadily over a season with momentum fluctuations.**  
*Validation:* The cumulative points timeline for selected teams shows periods of rapid point accumulation and plateaus, reflecting form swings.

## üìê Mapping Business Requirements to Visualizations

| Business Requirement | Visualization           | Rationale                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Team effectiveness   | Radar charts, bar plots  | Highlight multidimensional performance metrics   |
| Team progression     | Line graphs, heatmaps    | Show seasonal trends and match flow              |
| Tactical insights    | Pie charts, stacked bars | Simplify complex tactical analysis               |

## üß† Analysis Techniques

- **Descriptive Statistics** ‚Äì Summarize key metrics like goals, assists, and tackles.
- **Trend Analysis** ‚Äì Monitor progression over matchweeks and seasons.
- **Regression Modeling** ‚Äì Validate predictive hypotheses.
- **Clustering** ‚Äì Group similar team profiles or team styles.

**Limitations & Workarounds**:
- Handled missing data via imputation.
- Used dictionary renaming to resolve column inconsistencies.
- Modular design enhanced maintainability and interpretability.

**AI Contributions**:
- Assisted with exploratory ideation and code optimization.
- Streamlined visualization designs with feedback from generative prompts.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations

- No personal or sensitive data used; all sources are public domain.
- Bias avoided through full-season data coverage and inclusive metric tracking.
- Visualizations designed for fairness and clarity across clubs and roles.

---

## üß© Dashboard Design

### Features:
- ## üñ•Ô∏è Streamlit Integration

The dashboard is built using Streamlit for rapid deployment and interactivity.

### Key Streamlit Features:
- `st.slider` for dynamic player comparisons
- `st.selectbox` for filtering by club or season
- `st.plotly_chart` for interactive visuals

**User Experience Enhancements**:
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Tooltip integration for stat explanations
- Interactive filters (season, club role)
- Sliders for team comparisons
- Insight pop-ups and performance cards

### Communication Strategy:
- Technical Users: Raw metrics, regression plots
- Non-Technical Users: Intuitive visuals and high-level summaries

---

## üêû Unfixed Bugs

- Streamlit refresh lag with large datasets
- Real-time match sync not implemented due to API access limitations
- Tooltip logic refined after feedback but requires further optimization

**Knowledge Gaps**:
- Advanced dynamic plotting‚Äîcurrently under exploration
- Feedback from mentors helped clarify UX layout decisions

---

## üîß Development Roadmap

**Challenges**:
- Column inconsistency across CSVs
- Complex tactical plotting

**Solutions**:
- Python dictionary renaming
- Plot modularization across multiple scripts

**Next Steps**:
- Implement ML ranking models
- Add match simulation tools and forecasting

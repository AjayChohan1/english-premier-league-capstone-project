## ‚öΩ Dataset Content

This project uses two cleaned datasets:

- `epl_cleaned.csv`: Contains structured data covering player attributes, match performance, and team-specific metrics.
- `epl_final.csv`: Aggregated and transformed version optimized for dashboard presentation and advanced visualizations.

---

## üìä Business Requirements

- Enable strategic insights into player and team performance.
- Build interactive visualizations for scouting, fan engagement, or fantasy football strategy.
- Provide accessible analytics for both technical and non-technical users via an intuitive dashboard.

---

## üß™ Hypotheses and Validation

1. **Teams with higher pressing metrics concede fewer goals.**  
   _Validation_: Correlation analysis and regression modeling.

2. **Players with high pass completion and chances created drive team wins.**  
   _Validation_: Aggregated player contributions vs. match outcomes.

3. **Early-season transfers yield higher ROI than winter signings.**  
   _Validation_: Compare pre- and post-transfer performance metrics.

## üìê Mapping Business Requirements to Visualizations

| Business Requirement | Visualization           | Rationale                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Player effectiveness | Radar charts, bar plots  | Highlight multidimensional performance metrics   |
| Team progression     | Line graphs, heatmaps    | Show seasonal trends and match flow              |
| Tactical insights    | Pie charts, stacked bars | Simplify complex tactical analysis               |

## üß† Analysis Techniques

- **Descriptive Statistics** ‚Äì Summarize key metrics like goals, assists, and tackles.
- **Trend Analysis** ‚Äì Monitor progression over matchweeks and seasons.
- **Regression Modeling** ‚Äì Validate predictive hypotheses.
- **Clustering** ‚Äì Group similar player profiles or team styles.

**Limitations & Workarounds**:
- Handled missing data via imputation.
- Used dictionary renaming to resolve column inconsistencies.
- Modular design enhanced maintainability and interpretability.

**AI Contributions**:
- Assisted with exploratory ideation and code optimization.
- Streamlined visualization designs with feedback from generative prompts.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations

- No personal or sensitive data used; all sources are public domain.
- Bias avoided through full-season data coverage and inclusive metric tracking.
- Visualizations designed for fairness and clarity across clubs and roles.

---

## üß© Dashboard Design

### Features:
- Interactive filters (season, club, player role)
- Sliders for player comparisons
- Insight pop-ups and performance cards

### Communication Strategy:
- Technical Users: Raw metrics, regression plots
- Non-Technical Users: Intuitive visuals and high-level summaries

---

## üêû Unfixed Bugs

- Streamlit refresh lag with large datasets
- Real-time match sync not implemented due to API access limitations
- Tooltip logic refined after feedback but requires further optimization

**Knowledge Gaps**:
- Advanced dynamic plotting‚Äîcurrently under exploration
- Feedback from mentors helped clarify UX layout decisions

---

## üîß Development Roadmap

**Challenges**:
- Column inconsistency across CSVs
- Complex tactical plotting

**Solutions**:
- Python dictionary renaming
- Plot modularization across multiple scripts

**Next Steps**:
- Implement ML ranking models
- Add match simulation tools and forecasting
